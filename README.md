# MLOps Project Template

This repository is a **reusable MLOps template** for AI and data science projects.  
It provides a **config-driven, hardware-independent pipeline structure** with clear separation of source code, configs, data, and reports.  
The goal is to standardize project setup, ensure reproducibility, and accelerate development across different ML projects.

âš¡ **How to use this template:**  
- Do **not** develop directly in this repository.  
- Instead, click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create a fresh project repository.  
- Update the project name in `src/yourproj` and configuration files to match your new project.  
- Keep this repo unchanged as your base MLOps template.

**For environment setup and infrastructure instructions (including Docker, RunPod, etc.), please see the dedicated infrastructure repository.**

## Quickstart

Once your development environment is configured (e.g., inside a Docker container from the infrastructure repository), you can run the full pipeline.

The main training pipeline can be executed with a single script, which takes a configuration file as an argument:

```bash
# Run the full pipeline using the baseline experiment configuration
bash scripts/run_train.sh configs/exp_baseline.yaml

<!-- External cloud storage helpers removed from the template. -->
```

## Initialize a New Project

Use the one-time init script to rename the template package and metadata:

```bash
# Dry run
python scripts/init_project.py \
  --package my_project \
  --dist-name my-project \
  --title "My Project" \
  --kernel-name my-project-venv \
  --dry-run

# Apply changes
python scripts/init_project.py \
  --package my_project \
  --dist-name my-project \
  --title "My Project" \
  --kernel-name my-project-venv
```

This script:
- Renames `src/yourproj` to `src/<package>`
- Updates imports and metadata (pyproject name, kernel name)
- Adjusts titles in docs and notebook imports
